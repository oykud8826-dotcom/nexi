#  Nexi: AI-Powered Study Abroad Assistant (MVP)

> **Status:** Minimum Viable Product (MVP) | **Focus:** EdTech / Product Management
> **Tools:** Python, Streamlit, Pandas

##  Project Overview
**Nexi** is a prototype application designed to democratize access to study abroad consultancy. Instead of expensive agencies, Nexi aims to provide students with data-driven insights regarding **cost of living**, **university tuition**, and **city compatibility**.

This project represents my journey in **Product Management** and **Rapid Prototyping**—moving from a conceptual idea to a functional MVP using Python.

##  The Problem vs. The Solution
| The Pain Point  | Nexi's Solution  |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Information Overload:** Students are overwhelmed by scattered data on forums and websites. | **Centralized Insight:** Aggregates estimated costs and university data in one dashboard. |
| **High Costs:** Consultancy fees are unaffordable for many students. | **Accessibility:** A free-to-use tool powered by algorithmic matching. |
| **Uncertainty:** "Can I afford Rome?" is a hard question to answer accurately. | **Budget Calculator:** Provides data-backed monthly budget estimations. |

##  Tech Stack & Methodology
This project was built to test **Product-Market Fit** hypotheses and demonstrate technical literacy.

- **Frontend/Backend:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (Selected for rapid deployment capabilities).
- **Data Handling:** Pandas (For managing university & city datasets).
- **Development Process:** AI-Assisted Coding (Leveraging LLMs for code optimization and debugging to accelerate the development cycle).

##  Key Features (MVP)
1.  **Dynamic Budget Estimator:** Users input their lifestyle (e.g., "Frugal" vs. "Comfort"), and the app calculates estimated monthly expenses for target cities (Milan, Berlin, etc.).
2.  **University Matcher:** Simple filtering system based on department (Economics, Engineering) and Tuition Fees.
3.  **Visual Analytics:** Interactive charts showing the cost breakdown (Rent vs. Food vs. Social).

##  Pivot & Learning Journey
*Post-Competition Retrospective:*
Initially, Nexi was conceived as a purely generative AI chat interface. However, during the development and competition phase, I realized that **structured data** (hard numbers) is more valuable to users than generic text generation.
* **Pivot:** Shifted focus from a "Chatbot" to a "Calculator & Dashboard" model.
* **Next Step:** Integrating real-time data scraping for up-to-date rental prices.

##  Disclaimer & Attribution
This project serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate **Product Strategy** and **Python proficiency**. 
* **Code Generation:** Parts
